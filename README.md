# The OG Social Network

Final project for the Ruby on Rails course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project).

Everything learned throughout the course will be applied to this project. It's essentially a social network trying to clone Facebook with some touches of my own.

One of the most interesting features I look forward to implementing is the use of [Omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) allowing users to sign in with their existing Facebook accounts.
